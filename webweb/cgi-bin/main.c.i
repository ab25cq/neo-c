 * Facilities below assist adoption of -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, an off-by-default
 * Clang compiler warning that helps the developer minimize unsafe, raw
 * buffer manipulation in the code that may lead to buffer overflow
 * vulnerabilities.
 *
 * They are primarily designed for modern C++ code where -Wunsafe-buffer-usage
 * comes with automatic fix-it hints that help the developer transform
 * their code to use modern C++ containers, which may be made bounds-safe by
 * linking against a version of the C++ standard library that offers
 * bounds-checked containers.
 * They can be used in plain C, but -fbounds-safety is the preferred solution
 * for plain C (see also <ptrcheck.h>).
 *
 * Attribute __unsafe_buffer_usage can be used to label functions that should be
 * avoided as they may perform or otherwise introduce unsafe buffer manipulation
 * operations. The attribute can also be attached to class/struct fields that
 * are used in unsafe buffer manipulations.
 *
 * Calls to attribute annotated functions are flagged by -Wunsafe-buffer-usage, similar to
 * how unchecked buffer manipulation operations are flagged when observed
 * by the compiler directly. Similarly, use of and assignment to the struct/class fields
 * that have the attribute also get flagged by the compiler.
 *
 *   // An unsafe function that needs to be avoided.
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *   void foo(int *buf, size_t size);
 *
 *   // A safe alternative to foo().
 *   void foo(std::span<int> buf);
 *
 *   void bar(size_t idx) {
 *       int array[5];
 *
 *       // Direct unsafe buffer manipulation through subscript operator:
 *       array[idx] = 3;  // warning: function introduces unsafe buffer manipulation [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Unsafe buffer manipulation through function foo():
 *       foo(array, 5);   // warning: function introduces unsafe buffer manipulation [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *       // Checked buffer manipulation, with bounds information automatically
 *       // preserved for the purposes of runtime checks in standard library:
 *       foo(array);      // no warning
 *   }
 *
 *   struct Reader {
 *      // Field involved in unsafe buffer manipulation
 *      __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *      void *ptr;
 *
 *      __unsafe_buffer_usage
 *      size_t sz, count;
 *   };
 *
 *   void add_element(Reader rdr, int value) {
 *      if(rdr.count < rdr.sz) { // warning: unsafe buffer access [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *         rdr.ptr[rdr.count] = value; // warning: unsafe buffer access [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *         rdr.count++; // warning: unsafe buffer access [-Wunsafe-buffer-usage]
 *      }
 *   }
 *
 * While annotating a function as __unsafe_buffer_usage has an effect similar
 * to annotating it as __deprecated, the __unsafe_buffer_usage attribute
 * should be used whenever the resulting warning needs to be controlled
 * by the -Wunsafe-buffer-usage flag (which is turned off in codebases that
 * don't attempt to achieve bounds safety this way) as opposed to -Wdeprecated
 * (enabled in most codebases).
 *
 * The attribute suppresses all -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings inside the
 * function's body as it is explictly marked as unsafe by the user and
 * introduces new warnings at each call site to help the developers avoid the
 * function entirely. Most of the time it does not make sense to annotate a
 * function as __unsafe_buffer_usage without providing the users with a safe
 * alternative.
 *
 * Pragmas __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin and __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 * annotate a range of code as intentionally containing unsafe buffer
 * operations. They suppress -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warnings
 * for unsafe operations in range:
 *
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_begin
 *   array[idx] = 3; // warning suppressed
 *   foo(array, 5);  // warning suppressed
 *   __unsafe_buffer_usage_end
 *
 * These pragmas are NOT a way to mass-annotate functions with the attribute
 * __unsafe_buffer_usage. Functions declared within the pragma range
 * do NOT get annotated automatically.

 *		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple

 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being

 /*     
    These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
    and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
    were first available; and, if applicable, the OS versions in which they
    became deprecated and obsoleted.
     
    The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
    The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
    and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
    means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
    and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
    
    If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
    applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
            __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
    currently not implemented on the iPhone.

    At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
    recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a 
    better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
    functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
    macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
    as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
        __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
    means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
    became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function 
    has never been available.  
    
    For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range 
    it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
    -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
    when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
    but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
    Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.  
    
    Examples:

        A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);


        An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
        
            @interface MyClass : NSObject
            -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
            @end

        
        An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
        
            #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                enum { myEnum = 1 };
            #endif
           Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because 
           __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero. 
        

        An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
		
			enum {
			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
				...
		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
			  

    It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
    source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
    to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
    That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
    OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
    in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
    way.
    
        #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
            // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
            // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
            #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
                // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS
            #else
                // code here can assume Leopard or later
            #endif
        #endif

 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and

 *   '.'        Dot, matches any character
 *   '^'        Start anchor, matches beginning of string
 *   '$'        End anchor, matches end of string
 *   '*'        Asterisk, match zero or more (greedy)
 *   '+'        Plus, match one or more (greedy)
 *   '?'        Question, match zero or one (non-greedy)
 *   '[abc]'    Character class, match if one of {'a', 'b', 'c'}
 *   '[^abc]'   Inverted class, match if NOT one of {'a', 'b', 'c'} -- NOTE: feature is currently broken!
 *   '[a-zA-Z]' Character ranges, the character set of the ranges { a-z | A-Z }
 *   '\s'       Whitespace, \t \f \r \n \v and spaces
 *   '\S'       Non-whitespace
 *   '\w'       Alphanumeric, [a-zA-Z0-9_]

/*
 * Constraining pointer types based on contracts.
 *
 * 1. List of supported constrained pointers.
 *
 * 1.1. `Reference' pointers.
 *
 *      The `reference' pointers point to a single entity. The pointer
 *      arithmetics are not supported for the `reference' pointers.
 *
 *      The `reference' pointers are fully ABI compatible with
 *      the unconstrained C pointers.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `reference' pointers uses
 *      the `ref' constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t' is `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_ref_t' is `reference' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.2. `Checked' pointers.
 *
 *      The `checked' pointers represent contigous data arrays, which
 *      can be traversed only in the direction of increasing memory addresses.
 *      The pointer arithmetics are partially supported: decrements (p--, --p)
 *      are disallowed.
 *
 *      The `checked' pointers are not ABI-compatible with plain C pointers,
 *      due to the boundary checks instrumentation. See `ABI
 *      Compatibility Considerations' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `checked' pointers uses the `ptr'
 *      constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ptr_t' is `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_ptr_t' is `checked' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.3. `Bidirectional' pointers.
 *
 *      The `bidirectional' pointers represent contigous data arrays,
 *      which can be traversed in both directions. The pointer arithmetics are
 *      fully supported for the `array' pointers.
 *
 *      The `bidirectional' pointers are not ABI-compatible with plain C
 *      pointers, due to the boundary checks instrumentation. Additionally,
 *      passing `bidirectional' pointers to functions require the use of stack.
 *      See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the `bidirectional' pointers uses
 *      the `bptr' constraint tag. See `Naming conventions' below for furhter
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_bptr_t' is `bidirectional' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `uint32_bptr_t' is `bidirectional' pointer to `uint32_t'.
 *
 *
 * 1.4. Multidimensional constrained pointers.
 *
 *      Constraining multidimensional pointers is achieved by iteratively
 *      applying the constraints from the innermost type to the outermost type.
 *
 *      Pointer arithmetics are supported for the dimensions that
 *      are not constrained to a `reference' or `const reference'.
 *
 *      If any of the dimension constraints isn't ABI-compatible with its
 *      unconstrained counterpart, then the entire constrained multidimensional
 *      pointer is not ABI-compatible with the corresponding unconstrained
 *      multidimensional pointer. Otherwise, the two are ABI-compatible. See
 *      `ABI compatibility' below for further discussion.
 *
 *      The naming convention for the multidimensional constrained pointers
 *      combines the naming tags that correspond to the individual constraints.
 *      See `Naming conventions' below for furhter discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_bptr_t' is a `bidirectional' pointer to a `reference'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ptr_ref_t' is a `reference' pointer to a `checked'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *
 *
 * 1.5. Using `const', `volatile', and `restrict' type qualifiers with
 *      constrained types.
 *
 *      The use of the `const', `volatile', and `restrict' type qualifiers
 *      (a.k.a. "CRV qualifiers") follows the syntax of the C language.
 *
 *      As a special case, if a `const' qualifier is applied to inner
 *      dimensions of a multidimensional constrained pointer type, the
 *      constraint tag is prepended with letter `c'; thus `cref' can be used
 *      for const-qualified `reference' pointer. This abbreviation is only
 *      supported for the `const' qualifier, as use of `volatile' or `restrict'
 *      for inner constrained types is quite uncommon. See `Multidimensional
 *      constrained pointers' above and `Naming conventions' below for further
 *      discussion.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t const' is the const-qualified `reference' pointer
 *          to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ptr_t volatile' is the volatile-qualified `checked' pointer
 *          to `struct socket'.
 *      (3) `socket_ptr_ref_t const' is a const-qualified `reference' pointer
 *          to a `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (4) `socket_cref_ptr_t const' is a `checked' pointer to a
 *          const-qualified `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *
 *
 * 1.6. Combining constrained pointers and unconstrained pointers.
 *
 *      Unconstrained pointers to constrained pointers follow
 *      the standard C syntax. Defining constrained pointers to
 *      unconstrained pointers is possible via defining a constrained pointer
 *      to a typedef.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `socket_ref_t *' is an unconstrained pointer to `socket_ref_t', i.e.
 *          unconstrained pointer to a `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (2) `socket_ref_t const *' is an unconstrained pointer to `socket_ref_t const',
 *          i.e. an unconstrained pointer to a const-qualified `reference'
 *          pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (3) `socket_ref_t * const' is a const-qualified unconstrained pointer to
 *          `socket_ref_t', i.e. a const-qualified unconstrained pointer to a
 *          `reference' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *      (4) `intptr_ref_t' is a `reference' pointer to `intptr_t', i.e.
 *          a `reference' pointer to an unconstrained pointer to `int'. Note
 *          the use of `intptr_t' typedef, which is necessary at the moment.
 *
 *
 * 2. Defining constrained pointer types.
 *
 * 2.1. Declaring multiple constrained types simultaneously.
 *
 *      `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(basetype, basetag)`
 *      is the suggested way to declare constrained pointer types.
 *
 *      Parameters:
 *
 *      `basetype`: the pointee type, including `struct' or `enum' keywords.
 *      `basetag`:  the prefix of the constrained type.
 *
 *      This macro acts differently in the user-space and the kernel-space
 *      code.
 *      When used in the user-space code, the macro will declare
 *      types which are ABI-safe. See `ABI Compatibility Considerations'
 *      below for more details on ABI-safety. In the user-space code,
 *      the macro is guarded by the `__CCT_ENABLE_USER_SPACE' compilation
 *      flag.
 *      When used in the kernel-space code, the macro will declare
 *      the common constrained types.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) When used from the user space, and `__CCT_ENABLE_USER_SPACE'
 *          is defined, the expression
 *          `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(struct socket, socket);'
 *           will declare types:
 *
 *          (a) `socket_ref_t': the `reference' to `struct socket'
 *          (b) `socket_ref_ref_t': the `reference to reference'
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *
 *      (2) When used from the kernel space,
 *          `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPES(struct socket, socket);'
 *           will declare the above types, plus:
 *
 *          (c) `socket_ptr_t': `checked' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *          (d) `socket_bptr_t': `bidirectional' pointer to `struct socket'.
 *          (e) `socket_ref_ptr_t': `checked' pointer to a `reference'
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *          (f) `socket_ptr_ref_t': `reference' to a `checked' pointer
 *              to `struct socket'.
 *
 *      These additional types are not ABI-safe, and therefore are not exposed
 *      to the user space. See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below.
 *
 *
 * 2.2. Declaring individual constrained types.
 *
 *      The above macro attempts to do many things at once, and under some
 *      circumstances can be not appropriate. For these circumstances, a
 *      finer-graned declarator can be used:
 *
 *      `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(basetype, basetag, ...)'
 *
 *      Parameters:
 *
 *      `basetype`: the pointee type.
 *      `basetag`:  the prefix of the constrained type.
 *      `...`:      list of constraints:
 *                  - `__CCT_REF' for the "reference" contract;
 *                  - `__CCT_CREF' for the "const reference" contract;
 *                  - `__CCT_PTR' for the "checked pointer" contract; or
 *                  - `__CCT_BPTR' for the "bidirectional pointer" contract.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *          and call this type by `socket_ref_t'
 *
 *      (2) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF, __CCT_PTR)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `checked' pointer to `socket_ref_t'
 *          which in turn is equivalent to the type
 *              `checked' pointer to `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *
 *      (3) `__CCT_DECLARE_CONSTRAINED_PTR_TYPE(struct socket, socket, __CCT_REF, __CCT_PTR, __CCT_REF)'
 *          will declare the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `socket_ref_ptr_t'
 *          which is equivalent to the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `checked' pointer to `socket_ref_t'
 *          which in turn is equivalent to the type
 *              `reference' pointer to `checked' pointer to `reference' pointer to `struct socket'
 *
 *
 * 3. Using constrained pointer types.
 *
 * 3.1. Using constrained pointers for local variables.
 *
 *      Constraining the pointers on the stack reduces the risk of stack
 *      overflow. Therefore, it is highly suggested to use the constrained
 *      versions of the pointers for stack parameters. For local array
 *      variables, opt for the `bidirectional' pointers. If only a single value
 *      needs to be pointed, opt for the `reference' pointers.
 *
 *      There are two alternative approaches for using the `reference' pointers.
 *      One approach is to explicitly use `thing_ref_t ptr` instead of `thing *ptr`.
 *      The other approach is to surround the code with the directives
 *      `__ASSUME_PTR_ABI_SINGLE_BEGIN' and `__ASSUME_PTR_ABI_SINGLE_END', which
 *      will have the effect of turning every unconstrained pointer to its
 *      `reference' counterpart.
 *
 *
 * 3.2. Using constrained pointers for function parameters
 *
 * 3.2.1. Use `reference' pointers for scalar parameters.
 *
 *      Scalar parameters are safe to use across ABI boundaries.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `reference' pointers for scalar input:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_is_valid(const thing_ref_t t)
 *      {
 *              return t == NULL ? EINVAL : 0;
 *      }
 *
 *
 *      (2) Using `reference' pointers for scalar output, which is
 *          allocated by the caller:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy(const thing_ref_t src, thing_ref_t dst)
 *      {
 *              if (src == NULL || dst == NULL) {
 *                      return EINVAL;
 *              }
 *              bcopy(src, dst);
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *      (3) Using `reference to reference' for scalar output that is
 *          allocated by the callee:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_dup(const thing_ref_t src, thing_ref_ref_t dst)
 *      {
 *              *dst = malloc(sizeof(*dst));
 *              bcopy(src, *dst, sizeof(*src));
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 3.2.2. Use `checked' pointers for vector parameters.
 *
 *      When the ABI isn't a concern, use of `checked' pointers
 *      increases the code readability.
 *
 *      See `ABI Compatibility Considerations' below for vector parameters when
 *      ABI is a concern.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `checked' pointers for vector input:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_find_best(const thing_ref_ptr_t things,
 *                              thing_ref_ref_t best, size_t count)
 *      {
 *              for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 *                      if (thing_is_the_best(things[i])) {
 *                              *best = things[i];
 *                              return 0;
 *                      }
 *              }
 *              return ENOENT; // no best thing
 *      }
 *
 *      (2) Using `checked' pointers for vector output parameters that
 *          are allocated by caller:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy_things(thing_ref_ptr_t src, thing_ref_ptr_t dst,
 *                                size_t count)
 *      {
 *              for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
 *                      dst[i] = malloc(sizeof(*dst[i]));
 *                      bcopy(src[i], dst[i], sizeof(*src[i]));
 *              }
 *              return 0;
 *      }
 *
 *      (3) Using `reference to checked' pointers for vector output
 *      parameters that are allocated by callee:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_dup_things(thing_ref_ptr_t src, thing_ref_ptr_ref_t dst,
 *                               size_t count)
 *      {
 *              *dst = malloc(sizeof(**src) * count);
 *              return thing_copy_things(src, *dst, count);
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 3.3. Using constrained pointers in struct definitions
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using a structure that points to array of things:
 *
 *      struct things_crate {
 *              size_t       tc_count;
 *              thing_bptr_t tc_things;
 *      };
 *
 *
 * 4. ABI Compatibility Considerations
 *
 *      The pointer instrumentation process has ABI implications.
 *
 *      When the pointer insrumentation is enabled, the size of `bidirectional'
 *      and `checked' pointers exceeds the size of the machine word.
 *
 *      Thus, if there is a concern that the instrumentation is enabled only in
 *      some compilation units that use the function, these constrained
 *      pointers can not be used for function parameters.
 *
 *      Instead, one should rely on `__counted_by(count)' or `__sized_by(size)'
 *      attributes. These attributes accept as a parameter the name of a
 *      variable that contains the cont of items, or the byte size, of the
 *      pointed-to array. Use of these attributes does not change the size of
 *      the pointer.
 *
 *      The tradeoff is between maintaining code readabilty and ABI compatibility.
 *
 *      A common pattern is to split the function into the implementation,
 *      which is statically linked and therefore is ABI-safe, and the interface
 *      wrapper, which uses `__counted_by' or `__sized_by' to preserve ABI
 *      compatibility.
 *
 *
 * 4.1. When ABI is a concern, replace `bidirectional' and `checked'
 *        with  `__counted_by(count)` and `__sized_by(size)` for vector
 *        parameters.
 *
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using `const thing_ref_t __counted_by(count)' instead of `const
 *          thing_ref_ptr_t' for vector input in a wrapper:
 *
 *      errno_t thing_find_best_compat(const thing_ref_t __counted_by(count)things,
 *                                     thing_ref_ref_t best, size_t count)
 *      {
 *              // __counted_by implicitly upgraded to `checked'
 *              return thing_find_best(things, best, count);
 *      }
 *
 *      (2) Using `thing_ref_t __counted_by(count)' instead of `thing_ref_ptr_t'
 *          for vector output in a wrapper.
 *
 *      errno_t thing_copy_things_compat(thing_ref_t __counted_by(count)src,
 *                                       things_ref_t __counted_by(count)dst,
 *                                       size_t count)
 *      {
 *              // __counted_by implicitly upgraded to `checked'
 *              return thing_copy_things(src, dst, count);
 *      }
 *
 *
 * 4.2. When ABI is a concern, use `__counted_by(count)' and
 *        `__sized_by(size)' for struct members that point to arrays.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) Using a structure that points to array of things:
 *
 *      struct things_crate {
 *              size_t                               tc_count;
 *              struct thing * __counted_by(tc_count)tc_things;
 *      };
 *
 * 5. Naming conventions
 *
 *      If `typename' is the name of a C type, and `tag' is a constraint tag
 *      (one of `ref', `ptr', or `bptr'), then the name of a pointer to
 *      `typename' constrained by `tag' is `basetag_tag_t', where `basename'
 *      is defined by:
 *
 *      (a) If `typename' is a name of an integral type, then `basetag' is same
 *          as `typename'.
 *      (b) If `typename' is a name of a function type, then `basetag' is same
 *          as `typename'.
 *      (c) If `typename' is a name of a structure, then `basetag' is formed by
 *          stripping the `struct' keyword from `typename'.
 *      (d) If `typename' is a name of an enumeration, then `basetag' is formed
 *          by stripping the `enum' keyword from `typename'.
 *      (e) If `typename' is a name of a typedef to a struct or an enum that ends
 *          with `_t', then `basetag' is formed by stripping the `_t' suffix
 *          from `typename'. See (h) below for when `typename' is a pointer typedef.
 *      (f) If `typename' is a name of constrained pointer type ending with `_t',
 *          then `basetag' is formed by stripping the `_t' suffix from `typename'.
 *
 *      Additionally, constrained pointers to constrained const pointers are a
 *      special case:
 *
 *      (g) If `typename' is a name of a constrained pointer type, ending with
 *          `_{innertag}_t', and `typename' has `const' qualifier, then `basetag'
 *          is formed by replacing `_{innertag}_t' with `_c{innertag}'
 *
 *      Finally, sometimes `name_t' represents not `struct name' but `struct name *'.
 *      This creates additional special case:
 *
 *      (h) If `typename' is a pointer typedef named `{struct}_t`, such as
 *          `mbuf_t',  then creating a constrained pointer to a `typename' would
 *           require creating a  constrained pointer to an unconstrained pointer,
 *           which is not supported at the moment. Instead, a constrained pointer to
 *           `typeof(*typename)` must be created first, and constrained again. Using
 *           the `mbuf_t` example, first one should create a constrained pointer to
 *           `struct mbuf`, e.g, `mbuf_bptr_t`, and then constrain it again with
 *           `tag`, leading to `mbuf_bptr_ref_t'.
 *
 *      Examples:
 *
 *      (1) `int_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `int', following the rule (a) above.
 *      (2) `so_pru_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to function `so_pru',
 *          following the rule (b) above.
 *      (3) `socket_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `struct socket',
 *          following the rule (c) above.
 *      (4) `classq_pkt_type_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `enum classq_pkt_type'
 *          following the rule (d) above.
 *      (5) `classq_pkt_type_ref_t' is a also `reference pointer' to `classq_pkt_type_t'
 *          following the rule (e) above.
 *      (6) `socket_ref_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `socket_ref_t`,
 *          following the rule (f) above.
 *      (7) `socket_cref_ref_t' is a `reference pointer' to `socket_ref_t const`,
 *          following the rule (g) above.
 *      (8) `mbuf_ref_ref_t', is a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_ref_t`, and is one
 *          possible result of creating a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_t',
 *          following the rule (h) above.
 *      (9) `mbuf_bptr_ref_t', is a `reference pointer' to `mbuf_bptr_t`, and
 *          is another possible result of creating a `reference pointer' to
 *          `mbuf_t', following the rule (h) above.

/*
 * Network Service Type for option SO_NET_SERVICE_TYPE
 *
 * The vast majority of sockets should use Best Effort that is the default
 * Network Service Type. Other Network Service Types have to be used only if
 * the traffic actually matches the description of the Network Service Type.
 *
 * Network Service Types do not represent priorities but rather describe
 * different categories of delay, jitter and loss parameters.
 * Those parameters may influence protocols from layer 4 protocols like TCP
 * to layer 2 protocols like Wi-Fi. The Network Service Type can determine
 * how the traffic is queued and scheduled by the host networking stack and
 * by other entities on the network like switches and routers. For example
 * for Wi-Fi, the Network Service Type can select the marking of the
 * layer 2 packet with the appropriate WMM Access Category.
 *
 * There is no point in attempting to game the system and use
 * a Network Service Type that does not correspond to the actual
 * traffic characteristic but one that seems to have a higher precedence.
 * The reason is that for service classes that have lower tolerance
 * for delay and jitter, the queues size is lower than for service
 * classes that are more tolerant to delay and jitter.
 *
 * For example using a voice service type for bulk data transfer will lead
 * to disastrous results as soon as congestion happens because the voice
 * queue overflows and packets get dropped. This is not only bad for the bulk
 * data transfer but it is also bad for VoIP apps that legitimately are using
 * the voice  service type.
 *
 * The characteristics of the Network Service Types are based on the service
 * classes defined in RFC 4594 "Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service
 * Classes"
 *
 * When system detects the outgoing interface belongs to a DiffServ domain
 * that follows the recommendation of the IETF draft "Guidelines for DiffServ to
 * IEEE 802.11 Mapping", the packet will marked at layer 3 with a DSCP value
 * that corresponds to Network Service Type.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BE
 *	"Best Effort", unclassified/standard.  This is the default service
 *	class and cover the majority of the traffic.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BK
 *	"Background", high delay tolerant, loss tolerant. elastic flow,
 *	variable size & long-lived. E.g: non-interactive network bulk transfer
 *	like synching or backup.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RD
 *	"Responsive Data", a notch higher than "Best Effort", medium delay
 *	tolerant, elastic & inelastic flow, bursty, long-lived. E.g. email,
 *	instant messaging, for which there is a sense of interactivity and
 *	urgency (user waiting for output).
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_OAM
 *	"Operations, Administration, and Management", medium delay tolerant,
 *	low-medium loss tolerant, elastic & inelastic flows, variable size.
 *	E.g. VPN tunnels.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_AV
 *	"Multimedia Audio/Video Streaming", medium delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate
 *	and size. E.g. video and audio playback with buffering.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RV
 *	"Responsive Multimedia Audio/Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, variable packet interval, rate and size.
 *	E.g. screen sharing.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VI
 *	"Interactive Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium loss tolerant,
 *	elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate & size. E.g.
 *	video telephony.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_SIG
 *	"Signaling", low delay tolerant, low loss tolerant, inelastic flow,
 *	jitter tolerant, rate is bursty but short, variable size. E.g. SIP.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VO
 *	"Interactive Voice", very low delay tolerant, very low loss tolerant,
 *	inelastic flow, constant packet rate, somewhat fixed size.
 *	E.g. VoIP.

 * Local port number conventions:
 *
 * When a user does a bind(2) or connect(2) with a port number of zero,
 * a non-conflicting local port address is chosen.
 * The default range is IPPORT_RESERVED through
 * IPPORT_USERRESERVED, although that is settable by sysctl.
 *
 * A user may set the IPPROTO_IP option IP_PORTRANGE to change this
 * default assignment range.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT causes the default behavior.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH changes the range of candidate port numbers
 * into the "high" range.  These are reserved for client outbound connections
 * which do not want to be filtered by any firewalls.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_LOW changes the range to the "low" are
 * that is (by convention) restricted to privileged processes.  This
 * convention is based on "vouchsafe" principles only.  It is only secure
 * if you trust the remote host to restrict these ports.
 *
 * The default range of ports and the high range can be changed by
 * sysctl(3).  (net.inet.ip.port{hi,low}{first,last}_auto)
 *
 * Changing those values has bad security implications if you are
 * using a a stateless firewall that is allowing packets outside of that
 * range in order to allow transparent outgoing connections.
 *
 * Such a firewall configuration will generally depend on the use of these
 * default values.  If you change them, you may find your Security
 * Administrator looking for you with a heavy object.
 *
 * For a slightly more orthodox text view on this:
 *
 *            ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers
 *
 *    port numbers are divided into three ranges:
 *
 *                0 -  1023 Well Known Ports
 *             1024 - 49151 Registered Ports

 * Local port number conventions:
 *
 * Ports < IPPORT_RESERVED are reserved for privileged processes (e.g. root),

 *
 * When a user does a bind(2) or connect(2) with a port number of zero,
 * a non-conflicting local port address is chosen.
 *
 * The default range is IPPORT_ANONMIN to IPPORT_ANONMAX, although
 * that is settable by sysctl(3); net.inet.ip.anonportmin and
 * net.inet.ip.anonportmax respectively.
 *
 * A user may set the IPPROTO_IP option IP_PORTRANGE to change this
 * default assignment range.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT causes the default behavior.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH is the same as IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT,
 * and exists only for FreeBSD compatibility purposes.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_LOW changes the range to the "low" are
 * that is (by convention) restricted to privileged processes.
 * This convention is based on "vouchsafe" principles only.
 * It is only secure if you trust the remote host to restrict these ports.
 * The range is IPPORT_RESERVEDMIN to IPPORT_RESERVEDMAX.

 */

/* For checking general API compatibility when preprocessing */



/*
 * Macros to get the version in easily digested string form, both the short
 * "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" variant (where MAJOR, MINOR and PATCH are replaced
 * with the values from the corresponding OPENSSL_VERSION_ macros) and the
 * longer variant with OPENSSL_VERSION_PRE_RELEASE_STR and
 * OPENSSL_VERSION_BUILD_METADATA_STR appended.
 */

 */



/* Synthesize OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER with the layout 0xMNN00PP0L */
# 16 "/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include/openssl/macros.h" 2


/* Helper macros for CPP string composition */



/*
 * Sometimes OPENSSL_NO_xxx ends up with an empty file and some compilers
 * don't like that.  This will hopefully silence them.
 */


/*
 * Generic deprecation macro
 *
 * If OPENSSL_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATED is defined, then OSSL_DEPRECATED and
 * OSSL_DEPRECATED_FOR become no-ops
 */
# 74 "/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include/openssl/macros.h"
/*
 * Still not defined?  Then define no-op macros. This means these macros
 * are unsuitable for use in a typedef.
 */





/*
 * Applications should use -DOPENSSL_API_COMPAT=<version> to suppress the
 * declarations of functions deprecated in or before <version>.  If this is
 * undefined, the value of the macro OPENSSL_CONFIGURED_API (defined in
 * <openssl/opensslconf.h>) is the default.
 *
 * For any version number up until version 1.1.x, <version> is expected to be
 * the calculated version number 0xMNNFFPPSL.
 * For version numbers 3.0 and on, <version> is expected to be a computation
 * of the major and minor numbers in decimal using this formula:
 *
 *     MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100
 *
 * So version 3.0 becomes 30000, version 3.2 becomes 30200, etc.
 */

/*
 * We use the OPENSSL_API_COMPAT value to define API level macros.  These
 * macros are used to enable or disable features at that API version boundary.
 */





/*
 * We figure out what API level was intended by simple numeric comparison.
 * The lowest old style number we recognise is 0x00908000L, so we take some
 * safety margin and assume that anything below 0x00900000L is a new style
 * number.  This allows new versions up to and including v943.71.83.
 */
# 125 "/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include/openssl/macros.h"
/*
 * If OPENSSL_API_COMPAT wasn't given, we use default numbers to set

 * Define macros for deprecation and simulated removal purposes.
 *
 * The macros OSSL_DEPRECATEDIN_{major}_{minor} are always defined for
 * all OpenSSL versions we care for.  They can be used as attributes
 * in function declarations where appropriate.
 *
 * The macros OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED_{major}_{minor} are defined for
 * all OpenSSL versions up to or equal to the version given with
 * OPENSSL_API_COMPAT.  They are used as guards around anything that's
 * deprecated up to that version, as an effect of the developer option
 * 'no-deprecated'.

/*!
 * @typedef qos_class_t
 *
 * @abstract
 * An abstract thread quality of service (QOS) classification.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Thread quality of service (QOS) classes are ordered abstract representations
 * of the nature of work that is expected to be performed by a pthread, dispatch
 * queue, or NSOperation. Each class specifies a maximum thread scheduling
 * priority for that band (which may be used in combination with a relative
 * priority offset within the band), as well as quality of service
 * characteristics for timer latency, CPU throughput, I/O throughput, network
 * socket traffic management behavior and more.
 *
 * A best effort is made to allocate available system resources to every QOS
 * class. Quality of service degredation only occurs during system resource
 * contention, proportionally to the QOS class. That said, QOS classes
 * representing user-initiated work attempt to achieve peak throughput while
 * QOS classes for other work attempt to achieve peak energy and thermal
 * efficiency, even in the absence of contention. Finally, the use of QOS
 * classes does not allow threads to supersede any limits that may be applied
 * to the overall process.
 */

/*!
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * is interactive with the user.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at high priority relative to other
 * work on the system. Specifying this QOS class is a request to run with
 * nearly all available system CPU and I/O bandwidth even under contention.
 * This is not an energy-efficient QOS class to use for large tasks. The use of
 * this QOS class should be limited to critical interaction with the user such
 * as handling events on the main event loop, view drawing, animation, etc.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * was initiated by the user and that the user is likely waiting for the
 * results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive work, but relatively higher than other work on the system. This
 * is not an energy-efficient QOS class to use for large tasks. Its use
 * should be limited to operations of short enough duration that the user is
 * unlikely to switch tasks while waiting for the results. Typical
 * user-initiated work will have progress indicated by the display of
 * placeholder content or modal user interface.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT
 * @abstract A default QOS class used by the system in cases where more specific
 * QOS class information is not available.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive and user-initiated work, but relatively higher than utility and
 * background tasks. Threads created by pthread_create() without an attribute
 * specifying a QOS class will default to QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT. This QOS class
 * value is not intended to be used as a work classification, it should only be
 * set when propagating or restoring QOS class values provided by the system.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_UTILITY
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread
 * may or may not be initiated by the user and that the user is unlikely to be
 * immediately waiting for the results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below critical user-
 * interactive and user-initiated work, but relatively higher than low-level
 * system maintenance tasks. The use of this QOS class indicates the work
 * should be run in an energy and thermally-efficient manner. The progress of
 * utility work may or may not be indicated to the user, but the effect of such
 * work is user-visible.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND
 * @abstract A QOS class which indicates work performed by this thread was not
 * initiated by the user and that the user may be unaware of the results.
 * @discussion Such work is requested to run at a priority below other work.
 * The use of this QOS class indicates the work should be run in the most energy
 * and thermally-efficient manner.
 *
 * @constant QOS_CLASS_UNSPECIFIED
 * @abstract A QOS class value which indicates the absence or removal of QOS
 * class information.
 * @discussion As an API return value, may indicate that threads or pthread
 * attributes were configured with legacy API incompatible or in conflict with
 * the QOS class system.

 * The following magma script was used to generate the output:
 * securitybits:=125;
 * k:=1024;
 * for t:=1 to 65 do
 *   for M:=3 to Floor(2*Sqrt(k-1)-1) do
 *     S:=0;

 *       for j:=2 to m do
 *         s+:=(RealField(32)!2)^-(j+(k-1)/j);
 *       end for;
 *       S+:=2^(m-(m-1)*t)*s;
 *     end for;
 *     A:=2^(k-2-M*t);
 *     B:=8*(Pi(RealField(32))^2-6)/3*2^(k-2)*S;
 *     pkt:=2.00743*Log(2)*k*2^-k*(A+B);
 *     seclevel:=Floor(-Log(2,pkt));
 *     if seclevel ge securitybits then
 *       printf "k: %5o, security: %o bits  (t: %o, M: %o)\n",k,seclevel,t,M;
 *       break;
 *     end if;
 *   end for;
 *   if seclevel ge securitybits then break; end if;
 * end for;
 *
 * It can be run online at:
 * http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc
 *
 * And will output:
 * k:  1024, security: 129 bits  (t: 6, M: 23)
 *
 * k is the number of bits of the prime, securitybits is the level we want to
 * reach.

/*-
 * Key management
 *
 * The Key Management takes care of provider side key objects, and includes
 * all current functionality to create them, destroy them, set parameters
 * and key material, etc, essentially everything that manipulates the keys
 * themselves and their parameters.
 *
 * The key objects are commonly referred to as |keydata|, and it MUST be able
 * to contain parameters if the key has any, the public key and the private
 * key.  All parts are optional, but their presence determines what can be
 * done with the key object in terms of encryption, signature, and so on.
 * The assumption from libcrypto is that the key object contains any of the
 * following data combinations:
 *
 * - parameters only
 * - public key only
 * - public key + private key
 * - parameters + public key
 * - parameters + public key + private key
 *
 * What "parameters", "public key" and "private key" means in detail is left
 * to the implementation.  In the case of DH and DSA, they would typically
 * include domain parameters, while for certain variants of RSA, they would
 * typically include PSS or OAEP parameters.
 *
 * Key objects are created with OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_new() and destroyed with
 * OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_free().  Key objects can have data filled in with
 * OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_import().
 *
 * Three functions are made available to check what selection of data is
 * present in a key object: OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_has_parameters(),
 * OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_has_public_key(), and OSSL_FUNC_keymgmt_has_private_key(),

 * Unsolved problem: if a type is actually a pointer type, like
 * nid_triple is, then its impossible to get a const where you need
 * it. Consider:
 *
 * typedef int nid_triple[3];
 * const void *a_;
 * const nid_triple const *a = a_;
 *
 * The assignment discards a const because what you really want is:
 *
 * const int const * const *a = a_;
 *
 * But if you do that, you lose the fact that a is an array of 3 ints,
 * which breaks comparison functions.
 *
 * Thus we end up having to cast, sadly, or unpack the
 * declarations. Or, as I finally did in this case, declare nid_triple
 * to be a struct, which it should have been in the first place.
 *
 * Ben, August 2008.
 *
 * Also, strictly speaking not all types need be const, but handling
 * the non-constness means a lot of complication, and in practice
 * comparison routines do always not touch their arguments.

The X509_STORE holds the tables etc for verification stuff.
A X509_STORE_CTX is used while validating a single certificate.
The X509_STORE has X509_LOOKUPs for looking up certs.
The X509_STORE then calls a function to actually verify the
certificate chain.

 * The error code packs differently depending on if it records a system
 * error or an OpenSSL error.
 *
 * A system error packs like this (we follow POSIX and only allow positive
 * numbers that fit in an |int|):
 *
 * +-+-------------------------------------------------------------+
 * |1|                     system error number                     |
 * +-+-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * An OpenSSL error packs like this:
 *
 * <---------------------------- 32 bits -------------------------->
 *    <--- 8 bits ---><------------------ 23 bits ----------------->
 * +-+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
 * |0|    library    |                    reason                   |
 * +-+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
 *
 * A few of the reason bits are reserved as flags with special meaning:
 *
 *                    <5 bits-<>--------- 19 bits ----------------->
 *                   +-------+-+-----------------------------------+
 *                   | rflags| |          reason                   |
 *                   +-------+-+-----------------------------------+

 *                            |
 *                           ERR_RFLAG_FATAL = ERR_R_FATAL
 *
 * The reason flags are part of the overall reason code for practical
 * reasons, as they provide an easy way to place different types of
 * reason codes in different numeric ranges.
 *
 * The currently known reason flags are:
 *
 * ERR_RFLAG_FATAL      Flags that the reason code is considered fatal.
 *                      For backward compatibility reasons, this flag
 *                      is also the code for ERR_R_FATAL (that reason
 *                      code served the dual purpose of flag and reason
 *                      code in one in pre-3.0 OpenSSL).
 * ERR_RFLAG_COMMON     Flags that the reason code is common to all
 *                      libraries.  All ERR_R_ macros must use this flag,
 *                      and no other _R_ macro is allowed to use it.

  This structure is used to define bind information, and
  internally by the client library.
  Public members with their descriptions are listed below
  (conventionally `On input' refers to the binds given to
  mysql_stmt_bind_param, `On output' refers to the binds given
  to mysql_stmt_bind_result):

  buffer_type    - One of the MYSQL_* types, used to describe
                   the host language type of buffer.
                   On output: if column type is different from
                   buffer_type, column value is automatically converted
                   to buffer_type before it is stored in the buffer.
  buffer         - On input: points to the buffer with input data.
                   On output: points to the buffer capable to store
                   output data.
                   The type of memory pointed by buffer must correspond
                   to buffer_type. See the correspondence table in
                   the comment to mysql_stmt_bind_param.

  The two above members are mandatory for any kind of bind.

  buffer_length  - the length of the buffer. You don't have to set
                   it for any fixed length buffer: float, double,
                   int, etc. It must be set however for variable-length
                   types, such as BLOBs or STRINGs.

  length         - On input: in case when lengths of input values
                   are different for each execute, you can set this to
                   point at a variable containing value length. This
                   way the value length can be different in each execute.
                   If length is not NULL, buffer_length is not used.
                   Note, length can even point at buffer_length if
                   you keep bind structures around while fetching:
                   this way you can change buffer_length before
                   each execution, everything will work ok.
                   On output: if length is set, mysql_stmt_fetch will
                   write column length into it.

  is_null        - On input: points to a boolean variable that should
                   be set to TRUE for NULL values.
                   This member is useful only if your data may be
                   NULL in some but not all cases.
                   If your data is never NULL, is_null should be set to 0.
                   If your data is always NULL, set buffer_type
                   to MYSQL_TYPE_NULL, and is_null will not be used.

  is_unsigned    - On input: used to signify that values provided for one
                   of numeric types are unsigned.
